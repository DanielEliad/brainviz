# BUGS

- hovering over lines shows lines that are filtered out either by node selection or by edge threshold
- hovering over lines is not accurate and very fidgity maybe the hit boxes are too big.
- sizes of nodes is a little jitteray as a function of how many lines are coming out of them and their weights

# FEATURES

- highlighting a line by clicking it will add a border around it like selecting a node and gray out all the other lines
- add 3 equally spaced arrows instead of just one
