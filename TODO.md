# BUGS
- wavelet map has some dirty data on the edges because of padding all of the data to 146 timepoints
- filter out based on the scales below 10 seconds (need to convert to scales)
period per sub keep > 10s AND <100s + double AND

REST NOT NEEDED
- coi_per_sub, and period_per_sub period greater than 10 saved lower than 10 filtered
- coi make sure they are all zeros (no coherence)
- AND the two maps using the AND of both significance maps applied to the angle info color map (just use and of color maps)

# FEATURES

- total data comparison per correlation
- hosting it
