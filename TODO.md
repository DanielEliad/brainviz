# BUGS

- fix the tests (they search for phenotypic.csv but it isn't found make them use their own data dir in the test temp directory and generate your own data)

# FEATURES

- Side scrolling on the selection is kind of ugly. Maybe theres a way to make a UI thats folding in and out and just shows a snapshot of whats configured? or maybe we should just make the sliders prettier? plan out an improvement for the configuration UI.
